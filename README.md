OpenAI API Python Demos

This repository is dedicated to exploring and demonstrating the usage of [OpenAI's Python API](https://github.com/openai/openai-python). Here, you'll find a collection of examples, explanations, and demos that build on the official API examples.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: To provide clear, commented examples and demonstrations of how to use OpenAI's Python API.
- **Content**: Includes demo scripts (e.g., `demo1.py`, `demo2.py`, etc.) based on examples from the official OpenAI README, enhanced with additional commentary and explanations.
- **Future Plans**: More examples and custom implementations will be added over time, along with deeper explanations to help you better understand the API.

## Installation

Install the OpenAI Python library using pip (compatible with Linux and other platforms):

```bash
pip install openai
```

Ensure you have a working Python environment before installation.

# Demo Scripts

- **demo1.py**: A basic demonstration of using the OpenAI API.
- **demo2.py**: More advanced usage examples showcasing additional features.

Feel free to run and modify these scripts to experiment with the API and learn by example.

#####

To run all the python demos execute:
```bash
src/run_demos.sh
```

The first python script this main script will call is demo1.py which asks the openai API to respond like a pirate, resulting the results similar to:

Arrr, ye be usin' the `isinstance()` function fer that task, matey! Ye just need to provide the object and the class ye be checkin'. Here be the way to do it:

```python
if isinstance(your_object, YourClass):
    print("Aye, 'tis an instance of the class!")
else:
    print("Nay, 'tis not.")
```

Go forth and code like a true buccaneer! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
