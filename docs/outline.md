# Introduction

This section provides a hands-on introduction to OpenAI's Python API library, highlighting what developers need to know to start using it effectively.

The motivation behind this document is to help developers stay competitive as AI continues to transform the software industry—and many others. As traditional programming is increasingly complemented (or replaced) by rapidly evolving AI-powered techniques, it's crucial for developers to gain exposure to modern AI tools and workflows.

The approach here is **learning by example**. We’ll focus on real, intuitive demos that show how AI services can be used alongside traditional programming practices.

Our focus will remain on **industry-leading services**, **widely-used programming languages**, and **promising, trending techniques** that are shaping the future of software development.

A key goal is to demonstrate how AI services can be used in a **complementary** way with existing programming knowledge—rather than replacing it entirely. Once the basics are covered and a solid foundation in AI programming is established, we’ll gradually move toward more advanced topics such as **agentic programming**, which will be defined and explored in more detail later.

We’ve selected **OpenAI’s API** for the demos due to the company’s strong reputation as a leader in the AI space. For the programming language, we’ll use **Python**, given its widespread adoption in the AI community, ease of use, and strong ecosystem of libraries and community support.

These choices make OpenAI’s Python API library a natural and practical focus for this learning journey.

In addition to working directly with the API, we’ll explore the official **OpenAI Python GitHub repository**, starting with its README. This documentation is well-written and comprehensive, and it includes helpful links to OpenAI’s broader documentation and tutorials.

# [OpenAI Python API Library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)

OpenAI's Python API library offers a simple, reliable way for Python applications to interact with powerful AI models by communicating with OpenAI's services through a well-defined API interface. Under the hood, the library uses standard HTTP REST calls, abstracted behind clean Python methods. You can install it easily with the command:

```
pip install openai
```

The source code for the library is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).

To start using the API, you'll need to log in to [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/), create an account if you haven't already, and generate an API key. Once you have your key, running the examples and demos shown here should be straightforward.

The API provides access to a wide range of models and services, including:

- **Chat models** like `gpt-4` and `gpt-3.5-turbo` for conversational AI and natural language understanding  
- **Text completion** via legacy models like `text-davinci-003`  
- **Image generation** using **DALL·E**  
- **Speech-to-text** with **Whisper**  
- **Text embeddings** for search, classification, and clustering  
- **Fine-tuning** support for training custom models  
- **Function/tool calling** for structured outputs and integrations  

In this series, we'll start by exploring the **Responses API** and the **Chat Completions API**, which are at the core of many modern AI-powered applications.

# [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

OpenAI's language-specific SDKs leverage their HTTP REST APIs behind the scenes to interact with the OpenAI platform. As fully documented in the link above, these REST APIs use JSON for both request and response messages, offering remarkable flexibility for structuring API data. Tools like Postman provide an excellent way to inspect the messages in detail, while deepening your understanding of how the APIs work.

# Updated Definitions for Eight Terms

Below are the updated definitions for the eight terms, refined to reflect the distinctions highlighted in the guide.

## Responses API
An OpenAI API designed as an agentic primitive for building action-oriented applications. It accepts an input (as a string or an array of messages) and returns a typed response object (with fields such as `output_text`) that supports built-in tools like web search, file search, and computer use.

## Chat Completions API
An industry-standard OpenAI API for chat-based interactions that requires a `messages` array as input and returns a `choices` array with message objects. It is well-suited for multi-turn conversations, though the client must supply the full conversation history to maintain context.

## Response Input
The data or prompt provided to the Responses API, which can be a string or an array of messages. It serves as the basis for generating the structured, typed response.

## Response Instructions
Specific directives included in a Responses API call to guide the tone, structure, or behavior of the output, ensuring that the generated response aligns with the intended agentic tasks.

## Response Model
The variant of an AI model used with the Responses API to produce structured outputs. These models are optimized for tasks that may involve tool use or multiple model interactions behind the scenes.

## Completion Message Content
The text body of a message produced by the Chat Completions API, representing the natural language output from the assistant within a structured conversation.

## Completion Message Role
A tag assigned to a message in a Chat Completions API interaction (e.g., user, assistant, or system) that identifies the speaker’s identity or function in the dialogue.

## Completion Model
A machine learning model variant used in chat-based interactions via the Chat Completions API. It processes the full conversation history and generates contextually appropriate text completions.
